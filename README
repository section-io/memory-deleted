TODO
====

* icon for morbotron
* JS linting
* better subtitle line wrapping
* perhaps constraining the included subtitles to just 1 or 2 timecodes instead of all lines
* perhaps include a link to episode wiki
* convert to Slack app for all Slack teams
* publish to Slack marketplace
* enable preview of result before sharing
* change `/morbotron go <quote>` to instead:
 * `/morbotron meme <quote>`
 * `/morbotron meme /s\d{1,2}e\d{1,2}/ <quote>` # quote filtered to episode id
 * `/morbotron meme /s\d{1,2}e\d{1,2}/ /\d+/$` # exact episode id and timestamp
* put IAM KMS policy into git
